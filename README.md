# Jobs-to-be-Done and Outcome Driven Innovation: An Open-Source Guide

An open-source, practical guide to understanding and implementing Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) methodology and Outcome Driven Innovation (ODI) in practice.

## Mission and Philosophy

This project was created with a simple belief: knowledge should be free and collaborative.

Rather than selling another business book, this open-source guide aims to:

- **Democratize learning**: Provide practical, hands-on guidance for implementing JTBD and ODI methodology
- **Embrace critical thinking**: Explore not just how to use these approaches, but their limitations and when NOT to use them
- **Foster community improvement**: Enable researchers and practitioners to critique, improve, and evolve these methodologies
- **Expand the knowledge pie**: The more people who understand these approaches (and their constraints), the better the overall research community becomes

## A Living, Forkable Resource

This book lives on GitHub for a reason. Anyone can:

- **Fork the repository** and create your own version with different perspectives or industry-specific adaptations
- **Create branches** to experiment with alternative approaches or add new content
- **Submit pull requests** to improve the main text with corrections, case studies, or new insights
- **Open issues** to critique arguments, point out gaps, or debate methodology choices
- **Use the discussions** to share experiences and challenge ideas publicly

Market research is constantly shifting, and no single person holds all the answers. By hosting this book openly, the goal is to let the community shape it over time. Disagree with something? Fork it and write your own take. Found a better way to explain a concept? Submit a PR. Think a section is misleading? Open an issue and make your case.

The best ideas will rise through open debate and contribution.

## Why This Book Exists

Many researchers and product managers find themselves in a familiar situation: someone recommends the Jobs-to-be-Done approach, you begin researching how to implement it, and you encounter confusing and often conflicting advice. Despite the growing popularity of JTBD theory and Outcome Driven Innovation, there is a significant gap between understanding these concepts in theory and applying them effectively in practice.

This book addresses that gap directly. It is written for researchers, product managers, and strategists working in organizations ranging from startups to established enterprises, across B2B and B2C contexts. Whether you are conducting research for SaaS platforms, medical devices, consumer products, or professional services, the principles and methods here can be adapted to your specific context.

## What Makes This Book Different

This is not just another theoretical overview. Unlike other resources that treat ODI as gospel, this guide examines its limitations alongside its strengths. The methodology's rigid survey requirements, expensive implementation costs, and prescriptive outcome statement formats do not always align with real-world research constraints or organizational needs.

You will learn how to:

- Uncover the exact functional, emotional, and consumption-related outcomes customers use to measure success
- Understand the JTBD and ODI quantification process
- Recognize the critiques with the methodology and consider alternatives

The book also provides flexible approaches throughout. For teams with limited resources, you will find alternatives like MaxDiff analysis for prioritizing opportunities, or lightweight observational methods combined with targeted interviews to generate actionable insights.

## Who This Book Is For

- Product managers looking for a practical research framework
- UX researchers wanting to understand customer needs more deeply
- Strategists seeking structured approaches to market analysis
- Founders trying to validate product ideas
- Anyone who has tried to implement JTBD and found the existing resources lacking

## Book Structure

The book is designed to serve both newcomers and experienced practitioners. If you are new to JTBD and ODI, reading chronologically from start to finish is recommended, as each chapter builds upon the previous one.

**Part I: Foundations** - Theoretical background and when to use JTBD

**Part II: Practical Research Methods** - Interview techniques, job maps, and outcome statements

**Part III: Analysis and Prioritization** - Quantification, opportunity scoring, and synthesis

**Part IV: Implementation** - Organizational adoption and real-world application

**Part V: Limitations and Alternatives** - Critical perspectives and when to use other approaches

## On Complexity and Choosing Your Tools

This book focuses primarily on the Outcome Driven Innovation approach not because it is the simplest path, but because it is the most complex. Compared to the intuitive immediacy of the Moesta, Klement, and Maurya approaches, which are excellent for uncovering the narrative "why," ODI can feel dauntingly mechanical.

Think of the Jobs-as-Progress (Moesta/Klement) approach as a telescope. It allows you to see the big picture: the market forces, the emotional trajectory of the customer, and the "why" behind the switch. It is perfect for positioning, marketing strategy, and understanding demand.

Think of the Jobs-as-Activities (Ulwick/ODI) approach as a microscope. It allows you to zoom in on the specific workflow to see the cracks, the friction, and the inefficiencies invisible to the naked eye. It is perfect for product roadmapping, feature prioritization, and engineering specifications.

You do not have to choose between a telescope and a microscope. A good researcher uses both, or other research methods entirely.

## About the Author

Braden Buchanan spent five years applying JTBD and ODI methodologies at Roche's Diabetes Care Division, conducting lean validation studies on medical devices and digital prototypes. Working directly with ODI researchers and consultants taught him not just the theory but when to actually use this methodology and, just as importantly, when not to. This book distills that practical experience, focusing on real-world application rather than theoretical concepts.

## Acknowledgments

This work builds on the contributions of many researchers and practitioners in the JTBD community, including:

- Tony Ulwick for developing the ODI framework
- Clayton Christensen for popularizing JTBD theory
- Jim Kalbach for The Jobs To Be Done Playbook
- Bob Moesta and Alan Klement for the Jobs-as-Progress perspective
- The Roche ODI research team for practical guidance
- The broader JTBD community for ongoing discussions and critiques

---

The goal is not to sell you on JTBD as a silver bullet. It is to help you understand when it works, when it does not, and how to apply it effectively when appropriate. Knowledge grows through open critique and collaborative improvement.

Now, go get the job done.
