## Instructions for Claude Code: Adding Chapter 11 References

### Step 1: Locate the end of Chapter 11

Find the chapter conclusion that ends with:

```markdown
Now go build something that helps customers make progress on the jobs that matter to them.
```

### Step 2: Find and REPLACE the empty references section

There should be an existing placeholder:

```markdown
## Chapter 11 References
```

REPLACE that line (and any empty content after it) with the following:

```markdown
## Chapter 11 References
