  Market Definition Interview Guide (PDF)

**Description:**
One of the most common mistakes product teams make is defining their market by the technology they use (e.g., "The AR/VR Market") rather than the value they provide. This leads to fragile strategies that break when technology shifts.

This interview guide is a tool designed to help Product Managers and Consultants facilitate internal workshops or interviews with users. Its goal is to move your team away from a product-centric worldview and toward a stable, "Job-based" market definition.

**Use this guide to:**
* **Align your team:** Move stakeholders from a "Solution Mindset" to a "Problem Mindset."
* **Identify the true user:** Distinguish between the "Job Executor" (who uses it) and the "Purchase Decision Maker" (who buys it) to avoid building shelfware.
* **Future-proof your strategy:** Apply the "Time Travel Test" to ensure your market definition holds true regardless of technological trends.

  Master Interview Guide: Core Job, Job Map, Needs (PDF)
</DownloadLink>

**Description:**
This guide is a guide designed to help Product Managers, Researchers, and Founders conduct Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD) interviews. Unlike standard user interviews that focus on opinions or product preferences, this script focuses on **process**.

Using the "Universal Job Map" methodology, this guide provides a step-by-step script to deconstruct the user’s core workflow. It helps you move beyond vague customer statements to uncover the granular steps, hidden friction points, and needs for each step in the job map.

**What’s Inside:**
* **The "Middle-Out" Technique:** A method to anchor the user’s memory in the execution phase to prevent vague answers.
* **Universal Job Map Script:** Questions specifically designed to uncover the 8 distinct steps of any job (Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, Conclude).
* **Needs Translation Cheat Sheet:** How to turn user complaints ("It's slow") into need statements ("Determine the time it takes to...").
