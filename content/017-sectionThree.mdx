You have already defined who your customer is and what main goal they are trying to accomplish. Now, this section breaks that goal down into smaller pieces. Instead of looking at the job as one big task, you will learn to see the specific steps customers take and how they measure success. This process helps you find exactly where current solutions fail so you can build something better.

Here is what these two chapters cover:

### Chapter 5: The Job Map
This chapter introduces a tool called the Job Map. This is a step-by-step guide that lists everything a customer must do to finish a job. It does not focus on your specific product. Instead, it focuses on the customer's process.
* **The Framework:** You will learn an eight-step standard to ensure you do not miss any part of the customer’s workflow.
* **The Application:** You will see how to use this map to find spots where competitors are weak or where you can enter new markets.

### Chapter 6: Uncovering Outcomes and Needs
Once you have the map, this chapter teaches you how to define what "success" looks like for the customer at each step. You will learn to write specific statements that describe exactly what the customer needs. This chapter looks at the full picture of customer satisfaction, including:
* **Emotional Needs:** How the customer wants to feel.
* **Consumption Chain Jobs:** The effort required to use a product (like buying, cleaning, or fixing it).
* **Financial Needs:** The desire to save money or time.
* **Complexity Factors:** The specific situations or barriers that make the job hard for certain people.



By the end of this section, you will have a complete list of specific customer needs. This gives you the data you need to pinpoint where your customers are struggling and where your business can identify opportunities to grow.
