### Section 6 Overview: Formulate and Deploy a Winning Strategy

We have arrived at the final step of the process. You have defined the market, mapped the job, uncovered needs, quantified them with MaxDiff, and identified distinct segments. Now, the question remains: **What do we do with this data?**

In this final section, we will examine the traditional "Growth Strategy Matrix" often associated with Outcome-Driven Innovation. We will look at how it attempts to map underserved and overserved needs to specific business strategies.

However, we will also take a critical look at the limitations of "matrix-based" strategy. Real-world product strategy is messy. It involves regulatory environments, competitive pressure, organizational capabilities, and technological disruption, factors that a simple 2x2 grid cannot capture.

**A Note on Scope:**
This section will not provide templates for product roadmaps or executive pitch decks. Those artifacts depend entirely on your specific organizational context. Instead, this chapter focuses on the *interface* between data and decision-making. We will explore how to use your MaxDiff segments not as a rigid instruction manual, but as a powerful input to **de-risk your strategic bets**.

Let’s explore how to turn your data into evidence.
