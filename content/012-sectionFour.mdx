Section Four covers step 3 in the ODI process called, Quantify which needs/outcomes are unmet.

This section has arguably the most controversial chapter in the book, [chapter 7](/book/010-ChapterSeven), where I look to critique the ODI method of quantification. In chapter 7, I highlight some concerns I have with the opportunity scoring algorithm used by Strategyn, surveys that can potentially 50-100+ questions, and handling the different biases use to the underlying methodology.

[Chapter 8](/book/011-ChapterEight) offers one possible alternative approach to the ODI quantification methods by utilizing Maximum difference scaling (best-worst scaling) or MaxDiff. This approach as several positive aspects that make it quite appealing to product and researchers looking to implement the jobs-to-be-done and outcome-driven approach without all the underlying concerns that are outlined in [chapter 7](/book/010-ChapterSeven).

By the end of this section, you will have all the knowledge to know the practical limitations of the quant methods used by Strategyn and the original ODI approach, plus know an alternative that you might find practical to try out yourself.
