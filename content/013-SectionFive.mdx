This is the fourth step in the ODI process called "Discover hidden segments of opportunity." This is where we can start identifying distinct groups with distinctly different priorities based on their underlying needs and complexity factors. While Strategyn's traditional approach relies on opportunity scores from Likert scale data (with the limitations we explored in Chapters 7 and 8), I will explore how MaxDiff data can be used for segmentation as well. Using our Coffee MaxDiff example, we'll walk through clustering techniques that can help segment your data.
